# :airplane: Travel Inspiration App :ferry:
=====

Inspired by the Week 3 project mandate of Founders and Coders, the primary aim of this
project is to practice making API call requests.

To enable a seamless experience in viewing the output, I have chosen to use two APIs
that do not require the use of API keys:

* [REST Countries] (https://restcountries.eu/)
* [Exchange Rate API] (https://exchangeratesapi.io/)

### Minimum Viable Product :baggage_claim:
----

To ensure I achieved the main objective of creating something with APIs
without getting too carried away by all the interesting options that APIs provide (believe me, it was tempting!),
here was the checklist for the MVP:

1. An app that can generate a random travel destination suggestion and the exchange rate for the local currency
2. Make 2 API calls from different sources
3. A basic yet presentable user interface
